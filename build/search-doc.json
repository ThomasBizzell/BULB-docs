Users collect BULBmojis by expending daily energy to use write, read, react, comment and share. The BULBmojis collected will automatically translate into points for both readers and writers, placing them on a leaderboard. Users will be able to claim BULB Tokens from a pre-determined distribution pool based on their leaderboard ranking at the end of each week. This cycle repeats in perpetuity. Essentially, the more actions users complete, the more BULBmojis they will collect, the more points they receive, and the more BULB Tokens they will earn.
