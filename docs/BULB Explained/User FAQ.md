### Where are my BULB tokens?

BULB will allow you to connect your SPL wallet directly to the platform. Thus, all your BULB tokens will be stored in the SPL wallet of your choice. A popular SPL wallet is [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), which offers a wallet and browser extension with a streamlined, user friendly interface. BULB highly suggests Phantom for new users and those that want a simple and straightforward wallet experience.
