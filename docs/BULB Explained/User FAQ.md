### How do I convert my BULB Tokens into fiat currency? 

Currently, you cannot convert BULB Tokens into fiat currency. However, we expect users to be able to convert BULB Tokens into a more liquid cryptocurrency such as Solana or USD Tether via a decentralised exchange by late 2022. You can then sell your converted cryptocurrency to fiat currency on any of the major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. By 2023, we aim to list BULB Token directly on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, where you will be able to directly convert your BULB Tokens to fiat currency. To accelerate our roadmap, you can help by being an active member of the BULB community and assist in expanding the user base.
