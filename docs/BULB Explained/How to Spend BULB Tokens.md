## How to Spend?

There are 3 key ways for users to use BULB Tokens.

1. PAYG to bloggers in the community and read premium content
2. Mint and collect NFTs on the Solana Blockchain and trade NFTs
3. Buy and consume tradables such as BULB energy as you need it to do actions


Furthermore, the BULB platform will have an open marketplace where users can directly trade items with each other using BULB Tokens. For example, the unused energy of users can be traded on the market for BULB Tokens to another user who ran out of energy. Major NFT concepts include minting your own unique profile picture or tokenising your article. More use cases on the BULB platform are currently in development.


## BULB Token Distribution

Every week, a pre-determined token pool will be distributed to users. For instance, users will be rewarded 250 million tokens in total in the first year, i.e. 4,807,692 tokens will be distributed per week. The users rewards will be determined by the following formula:

Pool Allocation (%) = Your Points / Aggregate Points

For example, if User 1, 2 and 3 have earned 50 points, 30 points, and 20 points respectively, then each user will receive 50%, 30% and 20% of the total reward pool respectively.
