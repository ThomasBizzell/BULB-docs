## How to Earn?

Users can earn BULB Tokens in 3 simple steps.

1. Users collect BULBmojis by expending daily energy to use write, read, react, comment and share. 
2. The BULBmojis collected will automatically translate into points for both readers and writers, placing them on a leaderboard. 
3. Users will be able to claim BULB Tokens from a pre-determined distribution pool based on their leaderboard ranking at the end of each week.

This cycle repeats in perpetuity. Essentially, the more actions users complete, the more BULBmojis they will collect, the more points they receive, and the more BULB Tokens they will earn.

## BULB Token Distribution

Every week, a pre-determined token pool will be distributed to users. For instance, users will be rewarded 250 million tokens in total in the first year, i.e. 4,807,692 tokens will be distributed per week. The users rewards will be determined by the following formula:

Pool Allocation (%) = Your Points / Aggregate Points

For example, if User 1, 2 and 3 have earned 50 points, 30 points, and 20 points respectively, then each user will receive 50%, 30% and 20% of the total reward pool respectively.
