## How to Spend?

There are 3 key ways for users to use BULB Tokens.

1. PAYG to bloggers in the community and read premium content
2. Mint and collect NFTs on the Solana Blockchain and trade NFTs
3. Buy and consume tradables such as BULB energy as you need it to do actions


Furthermore, the BULB platform will have an open marketplace where users can directly trade items with each other using BULB Tokens. For example, the unused energy of users can be traded on the market for BULB Tokens to another user who ran out of energy. Major NFT concepts include minting your own unique profile picture or tokenising your article. More use cases on the BULB platform are currently in development.
