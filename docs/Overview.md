## Who is BULB?

BULB is a crypto-based blogging platform allowing users to earn BULB Tokens - powered by the Solana blockchain. BULB exists to create a digital community where ideas, passion and engagement are rewarded. By writing, reading, reacting, commenting and sharing blog posts on our platform, users are able to collect ‘BULBmojis’ which can then be converted into BULB Tokens. This creates a BULB crypto-economy, where engagement is the currency.
