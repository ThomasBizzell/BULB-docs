## Token Security

BULB Tokens are fungible SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens powered by the Solana blockchain, which is one of fastest blockchain in the world. You can find more information on the [SPL token program](https://spl.solana.com/token) and their [github repository](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token).

## Vesting Security

When the total supply is minted, a portion of it is locked up in a token vesting program for scheduled release. The vesting schedule allows BULB to deposit BULB tokens into a vesting contract and can only be unlocked to a specified public key at a certain time period. By locking a large portion of tokens in vesting contracts, the founding team is incentivised to stay committed to BULB and its users.

Bonfida's [token vesting program](https://github.com/Bonfida/token-vesting) is used to execute this and their code has been audited by Kudelski Security.

## User Security

Our users' security is a top priority and we take your trust in BULB very seriously. We can assure you that any data shared with us will be stored securely and protected. You can view our privacy policy [here](/privacy-policy). We also encourage users to create specific wallets for rewards, educate our users and help them solve problems related to wallets, the BULB Token and the BULB Platform.
