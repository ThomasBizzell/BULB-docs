## Who is BULB?

Write-to-Earn & Read-to-Earn with BULB.

BULB is founded on the concept to create a community where ideas, passion and engagement are all rewarded. As it stands, BULB is one of the first do-to-earn blogging platforms built on the Solana blockchain, and we are driven to popularise the concepts of write-to-earn (W2E) and read-to-earn (R2E). We are proud to be part of the Web3.0 movement and at the forefront of disrupting the way people read and write online.

In essence, BULB is a crypto-based blogging platform, where you can W2E and R2E. Our users can collect BULBmojis by writing, reading, reacting, commenting and sharing blog posts on the platform. The more BULBmojis users collect, the more BULB Tokens they will be able to earn. The BULB Token can be used on premium content, NFTs, and other tradables exclusive to the platform. They can also be held as a speculative asset.
This creates a BULB crypto-economy, where engagement is the currency.
